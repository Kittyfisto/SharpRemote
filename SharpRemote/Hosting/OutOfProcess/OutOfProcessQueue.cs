	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	///     This classes' right to exist comes from the fact that synchronizing the Start() and HandleFailure()
	///     events is quite complicated and brittle (a lot of callbacks => chance for deadlocks would increase) and
	///     therefore serialization using a worker thread and a queue is way simpler.
	///     The main problem is having to deal with late failures while we're in the process of starting the host
	///     application. Ideally we only want to handle those (successive) failures once the current process is finished,
	///     hence the approach using a queue.
